excerpt: '<b>Abstract:</b>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; This work introduces a multimodal framework that enables robots to efficiently collaborate with humans by hierarchically predicting human intentions and adapting to human trajectories. The framework perceives both speech and vision signals, promoting robustness of the framework. The hierarchy is demonstrated in two aspects. 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &bull;  First, we propose <b>hierarchical human detection through distance estimation</b>, which effectively eliminates potential interferences. This method significantly <b>boosts the precision of low-level human intention recognition</b>. 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &bull; Furthermore, we achieves hierarchy by utilizing previous intentions to predict future plannings and using predicted plannings to predict next-step human intentions. This approach involves the <b>decomposition of high-level planning into a series of sub-intentions</b>. This approch offers a more structured and efficient approach for robots to understand human intententions and interact with humans. 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; Besides, this approach also incorporates <b>trajectory adaptation</b> in intention prediction module, enabling robots to adapt to diffenrent human behaviors, thus promoting the robustness and adaptation abilities of our framework.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; We focus on testing the efficacy of our framework by doing user studies, dedicating to building a more user-friendly human-robot collaboration system.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; This hierarchical and multimodal framework has notable benefits. It substantially <b>enhances human-robot collaboration efficiency</b>, resulting in interactions that are <b>more robust, convenient, and intuitive</b>. This research contributes to the advancement of human-robot interaction and holds promise for a wide range of applications in robotics and automation.'
