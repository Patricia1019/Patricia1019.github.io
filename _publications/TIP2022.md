This paper is about proposing implicit pixel flow and double constraint strategy to recover perceptually-pleasant details for magnification-arbitrary single image super-resolution(As far as we know, this is the first model that can achieve this). Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that we successfully restore shape edges and satisfactory textures from continuous image representations, achieving or even outperforming SOTA models.

My contribution1: Proposed feature aggregation, designed confidence module and implemented main codes, achieving a SOTA infinite image super-resolution model.

My contribution2: Conducted all comparison experiments and ablation studies to form Fig.2, Fig.4$\sim$7, Fig.9$\sim$10, Fig.13, TABLE I$\sim$III.
