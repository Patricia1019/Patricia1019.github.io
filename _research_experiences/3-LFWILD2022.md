title: "Learning From the Wild: Imitation Learning From Real Life Demonstrations"
collection: research_experiences
type: "Project"
index: 3
excerpt: "We have developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that empowers robots to <b>observe videos in real-life</b> rather than under specific scenes, execute actions, and acquire knowledge of human actions through <b>action imitation</b>. To enhance the framework's performance and generalization, we have introduced <b>domain adaptation</b> techniques to align the behavior of robots with that of humans during training. Additionally, the robustness of the RL framework has been improved by integrating <b>optical flow</b> methods to extract human actions, resulting in more effective and precise learning outcomes. This research contributes to the advancement of robotics, particularly in the context of real-world video analysis and human action imitation."
