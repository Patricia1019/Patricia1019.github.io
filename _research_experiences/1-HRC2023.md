excerpt: '<b>Abstarct:</b>This study introduces a comprehensive framework designed to enhance hierarchical human detection and intention recognition in the context of human-robot collaboration. The framework incorporates two key components: hierarchical human detection through distance estimation and hierarchical human intention recognition via planning prediction. First, we present a novel approach for <b>hierarchical human detection through distance estimation</b>, which effectively eliminates potential interferences. This method significantly <b>boosts the precision of low-level human intention recognition</b>. Furthermore, we propose a methodology for hierarchical human intention recognition. This approach involves the <b>decomposition of high-level intentions into a series of sub-tasks</b>. This decomposition <b>facilitates planning prediction based on low-level intentions</b>, thus offering a structured and efficient means of understanding and responding to human intent. The implementation of hierarchy within the framework has notable benefits. It substantially <b>enhances human-robot collaboration efficiency</b>, resulting in interactions that are <b>more robust, convenient, and intuitive</b>. This research contributes to the advancement of human-robot interaction and holds promise for a wide range of applications in robotics and automation.'
