excerpt: '<b>Abstarct:</b>This study introduces a comprehensive framework designed to enhance hierarchical human detection and intention recognition in the context of human-robot collaboration. The framework incorporates two key components: hierarchical human detection through distance estimation and hierarchical planning prediction via intention prediction and trajectory adaptation. First, we present a novel approach for <b>hierarchical human detection through boundary-sensitive distance estimation</b>, which effectively eliminates potential interferences. This method significantly <b>boosts the precision of low-level human intention recognition</b>. Furthermore, we propose a methodology for hierarchical human intention-based planning prediction. This approach involves the <b>decomposition of high-level intentions into a series of sub-tasks</b>. This decomposition <b>facilitates planning prediction based on low-level intentions</b>, thus offering a structured and efficient means for robots to understand and respond to human intententions. Besides, this approach also includes trajectory adaptation for robots to adapt to diffenrent human behaviors. The implementation of hierarchical planning and intention prediction within the framework has notable benefits. It substantially <b>enhances human-robot collaboration efficiency</b>, resulting in interactions that are <b>more robust, convenient, and intuitive</b>. This research contributes to the advancement of human-robot interaction and holds promise for a wide range of applications in robotics and automation.'
