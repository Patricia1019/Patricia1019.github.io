excerpt: "<b>Abstract:</b>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; We developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that empowers robots to <b>learn from videos in real-life</b> rather than under specific scenes and execute actions through <b>imitation learning</b>. Considering the diveristy of wild real-life videos, to enhance the framework's robustness and generalization abilities, we introduced <b>domain adaptation</b> techniques to align the behavior of robots with that of humans during training. Additionally, to avoid being interfered by moving backgrounds in real-life videos, we integrated <b>optical flow</b> methods to extract human actions, both improving the robustness of the RL framework and achieving more effective and precise learning outcomes. This research contributes to the advancement of robotics, particularly in the context of real-world video analysis and human action imitation."
