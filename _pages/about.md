I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [`Intelligent Control Lab`](https://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/) at the [`Department of ECE`](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) of [`Carnegie Mellon University`](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [`Prof.Changliu Liu`](https://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/people/changliu.html).

My research focuses on `long-horizon robotic manipulation` using `neuro-symbolic` skill representations that bridge symbolic planning and continuous control. My work combines skill-based abstractions, TAMP, and learning-based methods to enable robust multi-stage execution and `failure recovery` in real-world environments.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation at Tsinghua University, advised by [`Prof.Jiwen Lu`](https://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/).

I am currently seeking summer internship opportunities in robotics, machine learning, and automation.
